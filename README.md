## Operations Performed in Excel

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- **Removed Duplicates**: Ensured there were no duplicate records in the dataset.  
- **Handled Missing Values**: Checked for missing values in key columns like `Income` and `Product_Price` and resolved them using appropriate strategies such as mean imputation or deletion of incomplete rows.  
- **Standardized Formats**:  
  - Reformatted the `DOB` column into a consistent `DD-MM-YYYY` date format.  
  - Ensured that numerical columns like `Age`, `Income`, and `Quantity` were in correct data types for analysis.  
- **Resolved Errors**: Identified and corrected inconsistencies in categorical columns such as `City` and `Gender`.

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- **New Calculations**:  
  - Created a **Total Revenue** column using the formula:  
    `=Product_Price * Quantity`.  
  - Extracted **Year of Birth** from the `DOB` column using Excel date functions.  
- **Segmentation**: Added categories based on income levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High) using conditional formatting and IF functions.
